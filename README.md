Bioinformatics Pipeline for generating quant.sf files is as follows: <br />

Download raw SRA files from NCBI SRA archive. <br />
Convert to Fastq files with fastq clipper. <br />
Use Salmon's paired-end clipping tool to clip low-confidence reads and possible adapters. <br />
Generate index file for mm38 transcriptome downloaded from Ensemble. <br />
Align and quantify raw sequence data with Salmon's Quant function. <br />
